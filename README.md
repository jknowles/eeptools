eeptools is a project for R that seeks to make it easier for administrators at 
state and local education agencies to analyze and visualize their data on student, 
school, and district performance. By putting simple wrappers around a number of 
R functions to make many common tasks simpler and lower the barrier to entry to 
statistical analysis.

The goal is not to invent new functionality for R, but instead to lower the 
barrier of entry to doing common and routine data manipulation, visualization, 
and analysis tasks with education data. By collaborating with other users of 
education data we can build transparent, efficient, reproducible, and easy to use 
functions for analysts.
