    administrative records easier and more consistent. Includes functions to
    clean strings, identify cutpoints, and quickly combine shapefiles and
    dataframes for plotting. Includes four alternative themes for ggplot2 as
    well as a wrapper for exporting graphics for inclusion in MS Office
    products. Also includes three example datasets of administrative education
    records for learning how to process records with errors.
